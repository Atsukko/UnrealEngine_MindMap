### This is a mind map of Unreal Engine structure made by me after reading a lot of source code of UE5 and articles about it, which includes gameplay structure, engine process and UObject related mechanisms such as reflection and garbage collection. 
### There may be mistakes in this mind map, if so, I hope you can contact me and I'll try to fix them, thanks for reading!
